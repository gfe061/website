I am researcher and associate professor in modern history at Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences working on economic history and politics and history of climate and energy. I teach in the program for International Studies with History. Current projects include political economies of electricity and the energy transition, history of carbon emissions, and global financial crises of the 1990s. Previous work included extended project on fisheries regulation and political economies. I also have an interest in digital and quantitative text analysis and use of machine learning in the social sciences and humanities.
