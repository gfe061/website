abstract: "In the aftermath of the Second World War, states across the world sought to expand
industrial fishing to both feed and employ their populations. This article examines the
structure of the post-war fishing political economies in two countries separated by
the Cold War divide: the Soviet Union and Norway. Their political-economic organization
and governing ideologies differed, yet many of the goals and objectives of resource
management were similar. The mechanisms to enforce regulation, however, were widely
divergent, reflecting varying configurations of state power and social control."
