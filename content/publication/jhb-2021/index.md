abstract: "This article analyses three fisheries crises in the post-war world – the Far East Asian Kamchatka salmon
in the late 1950s, the north Atlantic Atlanto-Scandian herring of the late 1960s, and the Peruvian
anchoveta of the early 1970s – to understand how each instance came to be understood as
a ‘collapse’ in widely differing contexts and institutional settings, and how these crises led to
changes in practices of natural resource administration and in politico-economic structures of the
fishing industry. Fishery collapses were broadly understood as state failures and, in response, individual
states increasingly claimed sovereignty over fish stocks and the responsibility to administer
their exploitation. Collapses thus became events critical in the remaking of management regimes.
Furthermore, the concept of a fisheries collapse was reconfigured in the 1970s into a global issue,
representing the possible future threat of depletion of the oceans on a planetary scale."
