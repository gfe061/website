abstract: "This article looks at how fisheries biologists of the early twentieth century conceptualized
and measured overfishing and attempted to make it a scientific object. Considering
both theorizing and physical practices, the essay shows that categories and
understandings of both the fishing industry and fisheries science were deeply and,
at times, inextricably interwoven. Fish were both scientific and economic objects.
The various models fisheries science used to understand the world reflected amalgamations
of biological, physical, economic, and political factors. As a result, scientists
had great difficulty stabilizing the concept of overfishing and many influential
scholars into the 1930s even doubted the coherence of the concept. In light of recent
literature in history of fisheries and environmental social sciences that critiques the
infiltration of political and economic imperatives into fisheries and environmental
sciences more generally, this essay highlights both how early fisheries scientists
understood their field of study as the entire combination of interactions between
political, economic, biological and physical factors and the work that was necessary
to separate them."
