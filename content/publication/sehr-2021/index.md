abstract: "Recent calls from within economics for increased attention to narrative
open the door to possible cross-fertilisation between economics and
more humanistically oriented business and economic history. Indeed,
arguments for economists to take narratives seriously and incorporate
them into economic theory have some similarities with classic calls for a
revival of narrative in history and abandonment of ‘scientific’ history.
Both share an approach to explaining social phenomena based on the
micro-level. This article examines how new methods in computational
text analysis can be employed to further the goals of prioritising
narrative in economics and history but also challenge a focus on the
micro-level. Through a survey of the most frequently used tools of
computational text analysis and an overview of their uses to date across
the social sciences and humanities, this article shows how such methods
can provide economic and business historians tools to respond to and
engage with the ‘narrative turn’ in economics while also building on and
offering a macro-level corrective to the focus on narrative in history."
