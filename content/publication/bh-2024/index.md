abstract: "This article examines why and how states use the legal and organisational
construction of the state-owned enterprise (SOE) to deal with
environmental and social crises. In 1973, in response to a drastic collapse
in the world’s largest fishery, the Peruvian state nationalised its anchoveta
fishing fleet and factories while hastily creating Pesca Perú, an SOE
given a monopoly on industrial catch and exploitation of the resource.
Pesca Perú struggled with a dual mandate and governments with
widely varying ideas of how the Peruvian economy should be organised.
In the early 1980s the enterprise lost its production monopoly due as
much to environmental factors as to political decisions. It was eventually
privatised in the 1990s. While generally regarded as a failed business,
Pesca Perú was a useful tool for a state with limited resources to pursue
governance and developmental objectives."
